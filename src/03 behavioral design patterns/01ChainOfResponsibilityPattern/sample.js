/**
 * For example, you have three payment methods (A, B and C) setup in your account each having a different amount in it.
 * A has 100 USD, B has 300 USD and C having 1000 USD and the preference for payments is chosen as A then B then C.
 * You try to purchase something that is worth 210 USD.
 * Using Chain of Responsibility, first of all account A will be checked if it can make the purchase,
 * if yes purchase will be made and the chain will be broken.
 * If not, request will move forward to account B checking for amount if yes chain will be broken otherwise the request will keep forwarding till it finds the suitable handler.
 * Here A, B and C are links of the chain and the whole phenomenon is Chain of Responsibility.
 */

// It helps building a chain of objects. Request enters from one end and keeps going from object to object till it finds the suitable handler.

// Translating our account example above. First of all we have a base account having the logic for chaining the accounts together and some accounts

class Account {
  setNext(account) {
    this.successor = account;
  }

  pay(amountToPay) {
    if (this.canPay(amountToPay)) {
      console.log(`Paid ${amountToPay} using ${this.name}`);
    } else if (this.successor) {
      console.log(`Cannot pay using ${this.name}. Proceeding...`);
      this.successor.pay(amountToPay);
    } else {
      console.log("None of the accounts have enough balance");
    }
  }

  canPay(amount) {
    return this.balance >= amount;
  }
}

class Bank extends Account {
  constructor(balance) {
    super();
    this.name = "bank";
    this.balance = balance;
  }
}

class Paypal extends Account {
  constructor(balance) {
    super();
    this.name = "Paypal";
    this.balance = balance;
  }
}

class Bitcoin extends Account {
  constructor(balance) {
    super();
    this.name = "bitcoin";
    this.balance = balance;
  }
}

// Now let's prepare the chain using the links defined above (i.e. Bank, Paypal, Bitcoin)

// Let's prepare a chain like below
//      bank.paypal.bitcoin
//
// First priority bank
//      If bank can't pay then paypal
//      If paypal can't pay then bit coin

const bank = new Bank(100); // Bank with balance 100
const paypal = new Paypal(200); // Paypal with balance 200
const bitcoin = new Bitcoin(300); // Bitcoin with balance 300

bank.setNext(paypal);
paypal.setNext(bitcoin);

// Let's try to pay using the first priority i.e. bank
bank.pay(259);

// Output will be
// ==============
// Cannot pay using bank. Proceeding ..
// Cannot pay using paypal. Proceeding ..:
// Paid 259 using Bitcoin!
